# Cat Drawing (Python Turtle)

## by Kayden Do ##

This project is my first ever Python program.

It uses the turtle graphics library and simple drawing commands to draw a cat based on a reference image found online.

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this project is to practice basic Python commands and learn 2D geometric thinking by using the turtle graphics library.

This project intentionally doesn't include animations or visual effects for the drawing.

This cat is static and it doesn't perform any actions, as I focused on drawing structure rather than interactivity.

## Development Notes

This project was created with AI assistance tools during the code process.

The code ran correctly without syntax or runtime errors.
However, the initial turtle drawing looked unbalanced and visually unnatural.

The code was manually refined by adjusting coordinates, ratios, and drawing commands to match the reference image better.

## Usage

Run the program using:

```bash
python Cat_drawing.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- turtle (built-in Python library)

## Features

- Draws a cat using Python turtle graphics
- Uses basic shapes and simple commands to draw
- Beginner-friendly

## Reference Image

The drawing is based on a reference drawing found online.

This project was created mainly for learning and practice.
